However, in February 2025, author Ashley St. Clair revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that she had given birth to Musk’s 13th child. St. Clair stated that she and Musk had been privately working on an agreement regarding the child’s upbringing, but Musk has not publicly acknowledged the child.

Musk has previously been in relationships with several public figures, including actress Amber Heard and musician Grimes, with whom he shares three children. He has also fathered three children with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis. Despite his personal life often being in the public eye, Musk primarily focuses on his business ventures and has not made any recent relationship confirmations.

Elon Musk’s relationship history
Elon Musk’s first marriage was to Canadian author Justine Musk, whom he married in 2000. The couple had six children, but their firstborn passed away from sudden infant death syndrome in 2002. They later had twins and triplets before divorcing in 2008. Shortly after, Musk married English actress Talulah Riley in 2010. They divorced in 2012, remarried in 2013, and finalized their second divorce in 2016.

Following his marriages, Musk was linked to actress Amber Heard in 2016. Their relationship lasted intermittently until 2018 (via People). In 2018, he began dating musician Grimes, and they welcomed their first child in 2020. They had two more children together before their relationship ended. Around the same time, Musk fathered twins with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis in 2021 and welcomed a third child with her in 2024.In 2025, Ashley St. Clair announced the birth of Musk’s 13th child. Musk has previously expressed concerns about declining birth rates and has stated that he is doing his part to address what he calls the “underpopulation crisis.”</p>
